title: "Should the choice of BOIN design parameter p.tox only depend on the target DLT rate?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'This study demonstrates the importance of interpreting BOIN design parameter p.tox as an interval of toxicity rates that are considered too toxic, rather than one prespecified value that corresponds to the lowest toxicity probability that is deemed overly toxic. When designing a dose-finding trial using BOIN, it is important to perform simulation studies to identify equivalent sets of BOIN design parameters that can generate the same boundary table so that we can better compare the safety properties of different boundary tables.
